      <hr>
      <p>I don't have a precise idea of Where I Really want to work. I got a preference for jobs linked with telecomunications but it is not a must-have. All i know is that i want to go further in my studies (maybe for a  master (BAC +5))  to do an occupational integration after.</p>
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I'm able to produce any written document with word or libre office. I can do it also with an Excel document but the delays are going to be longer because i'm not an expert in this domain. I'm quite resourceful with computers in general, I'm able to solve just about any problem when they don't work.
      </br>
      </br>I am a sociable person, That make me more efficient when I have to work in group, and I should say that i love it. Finaly, I can say that I am really flexible, I am able to adapt myself in front of the problem and find a solution or bypass a problem.</p>
